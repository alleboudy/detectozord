# Exercise2 notes:
First all of the assignment steps are performed on the chocolate image scene (will need to click keys 5 times to skip the steps)
Then a live video will be caputred where you can present your chocolate bar to the cam (we used chocolate3.jpg as the template to search for) and it will be replaced with the chocolate1.png image

## Exercise2 bonus fun toy deliverable instructions :D
Rename einstien.jpg to chocolate1.png 
Replace Chocolate3.jpg with a grayscale image of your face with a smooth background and nice lighting of size 354x480 (see example wa.png)
Run the exercise and take a similar pose as in your personal face image
