# Exercise4 notes:
Visualization.ipynb is for problem number 4 Feature Visualization in the exercise

# Exercise3 notes:
the training notebook now is up to date, also the prediction notebook, however training.py is used for training and modifiedutils, is using python 2 , apologies for this

# Exercise2 notes:
Please note that:
THRESHOLD variable is defined and used to skip further processing if the number
of inlier matches is less than it, we found that using a radically different tem
plate from the image in the scene results in very little matching keypoints and thus poor homography
