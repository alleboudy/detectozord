# Exercise6 notes:
Question 6.3.b setting the first cloud as referece, the result seems to align all of the clouds to it, not benefiting from the plane
and in my dev environment I got some breakpoint errors in visual studio, clicking continue (several times) made it work eventually for the ex 6.3.b point, unfortunately, unable to get a readable error from it
also, the clouds when plotted are always shown flipped since ex5, perhaps we are missing some small detail?


# Exercise5 notes:
data/outcomes includes sample outcomes

# Exercise4 notes:
Visualization.ipynb is for problem number 4 Feature Visualization in the exercise

under ssd/ is demo.py for problem number 5

# Exercise3 notes:
the training notebook now is up to date, also the prediction notebook,
however training.py is used for training and modifiedutils, is using python 2 , apologies for this

# Exercise2 notes:
Please note that:
THRESHOLD variable is defined and used to skip further processing if the number
of inlier matches is less than it, we found that using a radically different tem
plate from the image in the scene results in very little matching keypoints and thus poor homography
