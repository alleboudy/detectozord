# Exercise7 notes:
After multiple tries we settled on using global hypothesis verification instead of the greedy one 
the implementation of greedy is left commented in both problems for validation
We still need to better tune the parameters of the pipeline, however. 

# Exercise6 notes:
issues with the parameters are fixed for Ex6.2 and it perfectly aligens, however, ex6.3 aren't perfectly aligned unfortunately, would appreciate any pointers or guidelines, thanks.


# Exercise5 notes:
data/outcomes includes sample outcomes

# Exercise4 notes:
Visualization.ipynb is for problem number 4 Feature Visualization in the exercise

under ssd/ is demo.py for problem number 5

# Exercise3 notes:
the training notebook now is up to date, also the prediction notebook,
however training.py is used for training and modifiedutils, is using python 2 , apologies for this

# Exercise2 notes:
Please note that:
THRESHOLD variable is defined and used to skip further processing if the number
of inlier matches is less than it, we found that using a radically different tem
plate from the image in the scene results in very little matching keypoints and thus poor homography
