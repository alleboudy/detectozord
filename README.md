# Exercise2 notes:
First all of the assignment steps are performed on the chocolate image scene (will need to click keys 5 times to skip the steps)
Then a live video will be caputred where you can present your chocolate bar to the cam (we used chocolate1.png as the template to search for) and it will be replaced with the chocolate2.png image


Please note that:
THRESHOLD variable is defined and used to skip further processing if the number
of inlier matches is less than it, we found that using a radically different tem
plate from the image in the scene results in very little matching keypoints and thus poor homography


## Exercise2 bonus fun toy deliverable instructions :D
Rename einstien.jpg to chocolate1.png 
Replace Chocolate3.jpg with a grayscale image of your face with a smooth background and nice lighting of size 354x480 (see example wa.png)
Run the exercise and take a similar pose as in your personal face image
