# Exercise2 notes:
the training notebook now is up to date, also the prediction notebook, however training.py is used for training and modifiedutils, is using python 2 , apologies for this


Please note that:
THRESHOLD variable is defined and used to skip further processing if the number
of inlier matches is less than it, we found that using a radically different tem
plate from the image in the scene results in very little matching keypoints and thus poor homography


## Exercise2 bonus fun toy deliverable instructions :D
Rename einstien.jpg to chocolate1.png 
Replace Chocolate3.jpg with a grayscale image of your face with a smooth background and nice lighting of size 354x480 (see example wa.png)
Run the exercise and take a similar pose as in your personal face image
