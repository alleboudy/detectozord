# Exercise6 notes:
Question 6.b a reference cloud for the registeration isn't provided, 
perhaps we should fix one of the clouds as a reference, 
but then the point2point metric will fail as the clouds are taken from different sides of the head?
Also, an issue we are having since last exercise, the clouds are always shown inverted,
perhaps we are missing a tiny detail, our apologies for the inconvenience

# Exercise5 notes:
data/outcomes includes sample outcomes

# Exercise4 notes:
Visualization.ipynb is for problem number 4 Feature Visualization in the exercise

under ssd/ is demo.py for problem number 5

# Exercise3 notes:
the training notebook now is up to date, also the prediction notebook,
however training.py is used for training and modifiedutils, is using python 2 , apologies for this

# Exercise2 notes:
Please note that:
THRESHOLD variable is defined and used to skip further processing if the number
of inlier matches is less than it, we found that using a radically different tem
plate from the image in the scene results in very little matching keypoints and thus poor homography
